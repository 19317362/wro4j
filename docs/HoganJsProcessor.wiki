#summary What is HoganJsProcessor and how to use it.

= Introduction =
[http://twitter.github.com/hogan.js/ Hogan.js] is a 2.5k JS templating engine developed at Twitter. Use it as a part of your asset packager to compile templates ahead of time or include it in your browser to handle dynamic templates.

It is very similar to [HandlebarsJsProcessor] & [DustJsProcessor].

= Configuring with wro4j =
Using HoganJsProcessor is as simple as adding the following line in {{{wro.properties}}}:


{{{
preProcessors=hoganJs
}}}

or 

{{{
preProcessors=hoganJs.template
}}}
if you want to process only resources with {{{template}} extension.
